This section is for all things involving ground based computers that are supporting the quad experiments. 


For information regarding: 

- Optitrack (our Motion Capture System)
- Connecting to the Local Network
- Using ROS
- Our current Flightroom-specific computer setup 
- and much, much, more

see the `MSL Flightroom Documentation <https://stanfordflightroom.github.io/documentation>`_!

These tools are useful if you want to monitor the status of the quad from your personal laptop, acquire near ground truth pose information of rigid bodies, or just synchronize your computer's clock with that of the quads.
