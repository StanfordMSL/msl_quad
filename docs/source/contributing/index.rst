Don't Forget Documentation
==========================

This is essential for both new code and existing code. Whenever you submit new
features, bug fixes, etc., you must make sure the documentation exists and is
accurate to the current PR. Check out our
:doc:`getting_started_with_documentation` for procedures and information
important to all documentation in the repo.
