Here you will find the :doc:`build_materials` and the :doc:`wiring_diagrams` for building a new quad. The mslquad uses a modified build of the classic F330 firewheel frame. While the quads are designed mostly for indoor use, the can still be used outdoors using a GPS unit. On a full charge the unit will fly for about 10-15 minutes.
